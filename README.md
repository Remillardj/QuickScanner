# QuickScanner
QuickScanner is a lightweight port scanner written in C. It takes input of the user of the IP address and number of ports to scan then prints if a port is opened.

# Running Program
It has never been more easy to run a program. Simply do `gcc QuickScanner.c` and then `./a.out xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx` and it will begin to scan.
